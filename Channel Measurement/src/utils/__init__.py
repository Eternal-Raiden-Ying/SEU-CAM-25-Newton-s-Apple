#   here is the init file
#   when you add a new function,
# please make sure it is also added in __init__.py,
# so that it could be easily imported
#
#   note that import * means import all things
#
#   another thing:  if you don't know how to use,
#   see the comments,
#   or the example in the main func
#   or just ask the author
